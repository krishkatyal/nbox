# 🏁 Get Started


**Install the package from pipy:**

```pip install nbox```


For convinience you should add nbox to your path by setting up an alias. Throughout the rest of the documentation we will be using nbx as the CLI:

```# go to your .bashrc or .zshrc and add
alias nbx="python3 -m nbox"
```



When loading nbox for the first time, it will prompt you the username and password and create a secrets file at ```~/.nbx/secrets.json. ``` This file then contains all the information that you don’t have to fetch manually again.


## APIs

Our APIs are deep, user functions are kept to minimum and most relavant. This documentation contains the full spec of everything, but here’s all the APIs you need to know:

```
nbox
├── Model          # Framework agnostic Model
│   ├── __call__
│   ├── deploy
│   ├── train_on_instance (WIP)
│   └── train_on_jobs (WIP)
├── Operators      # How jobs are combinations of operators
│   ├── __call__
│   └── deploy
├── Jobs           # For controlling all your jobs
│   ├── logs       # stream logs right on your terminal
│   └── trigger    # manually trigger a job
└── Instance
   ├── __call__    # Run any command on the instance
   └── mv (WIP)    # Move files to and from NBX-Build
```
### Deploy your machine learning or statistical models:

```python
from nbox import Model
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer

# define your pre and post processing functions
def pre(x: Dict):
  return AutoTokenizer(**x)

# load your classifier with functions
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distill-bert")
classifier = Model(model, pre = pre)

# call your model
classifier(f"Is this a good picture?")

# get full control on exporting it
spec = classifier.torch_to_onnx(
  TorchToOnnx(...)
)

# confident? deploy it your cloud
url, key = classifier.deploy(
  spec, deployment_id_or_name = "classification"
)

# use it anywhere
pred = requests.post(
  url,
  json = {
    "text": f"Is this a good picture?"
  },
  header = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {key}"}
).json()
```
